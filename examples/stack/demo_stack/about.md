# About

Beet is a pre-release framework built on the **Bevy** game engine, aligned with user-modifiable software like *Smalltalk* and *HyperCard*.

## Philosophy

Content is described by its **meaning** rather than its appearance. This semantic approach allows the same content to be rendered across diverse interfaces:

- A visual UI renders importance as **bold** text
- A voice assistant uses a louder or more emphatic tone
- A braille display indicates importance through its own conventions

## Architecture

Beet uses an *entity-component-system* architecture where content is represented as a tree of entities, each carrying semantic components like headings, paragraphs, and inline markers.
