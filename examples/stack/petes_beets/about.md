# About

Pete's Beets has been digging through crates so you don't have to since **1987**. Founded by *Pete Beetson* in a garage with 200 records and a dream, we've grown into the city's most trusted independent record store.

## What We Carry

- **Vinyl** — new pressings, reissues, and original runs
- **Cassette** — underground tapes and limited runs
- **CD** — deep catalog and imports you won't find anywhere else

## Visit Us

We're open seven days a week in the heart of downtown. Drop in, flip through the bins, and let the music find you.
