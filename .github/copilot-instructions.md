# Copilot instructions

- Always greet the user by saying something foolish, here are some examples but you should come up with your own instead of using these:
	- jumbajumba
	- chickadoodoo
	- i'm a little teapot
	- choo choo i'm a tank engine
	- whats good chicken
- dont respond with a prefix 'short answer: '. just give the answer and if its short thats self evident.
- when discussing code, assume rust unless user specifies otherwise
- when agent is told to run a command run that command before doing anything else, including searching the codebase
- Always use rust conventions, unit tests at the bottom of the file are preferred over separate test files.
- Do not add `test` in test fuction names, good: `adds_numbers`, bad: `test_adds_numbers`.
- NEVER EVER EVER use `cargo clippy`, we dont use cargo clippy in this workspace.
- aim to leave code better than you found it, add missing documentation, edit ambiguous language and clean up antipatterns.
- documentation should always be as short and concise as possible.
- Do not create non-doc examples without being explictly asked to do so.
- Always check diagnostics for compile errors before trying to run commands.
- Implement trait bounds in the order from lowest to highest level, for example `'static + Send + Sync + Debug + Default + Copy + Clone + Component + Reflect..`
- Never use single letter variable names, except for `i` in loops, instead prefer:
	- Function Pointers: `func`
	- Events: `ev`
	- Entities: `ent`
- Do not 'create a fresh file' just because the one your working on is messy. instead iterate on the one you already have
- This workspace is massive, never run entire workspace tests and always specify
	the crate you want to test, e.g. `cargo test -p beet_rsx`.
- In the case of `long().method().chains()` we prefer to continue chains than store temporary variables. We provide blanket traits in `beet_utils::prelude::*` to assist with this, including `.xmap()` which is just like `.map()` for iterators, but works for any type.
- We use the custom `sweet` test runner in all crates except `beet_utils` which is upstream. prefers matchers .
- Sweet uses method chaining matchers instead of `assert!`:
	- `some().long().chain().xpect_true();`
	- `some().long().chain().xpect_close(0.300001);`
- Sweet matchers are not a replacement for `.unwrap()`. always use `.unwrap()` or `.unwrap_err()` in tests when you just want to get the value
