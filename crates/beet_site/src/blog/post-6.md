I spent much of my twenties travelling the festival circuit in Serenity, my beloved Mitsubishi Express. I started working at the commercial festivals I'd attended as a teenager, but quickly discovered what I love about festivals is better represented in folk culture. Before long I was exclusively seeking folk festivals and alternative gatherings where the lines between organizer, performer and attendee are blurred, and in some cases dissappear completely. In this culture the experience is crafted by each participant and the result is radical individuality, for me this meant dressing up like a pirate and performing to an audience not much bigger than our own motley crew.

The difference in these experiences is reflected in the tools that produce them. Commercial festivals are built on tools of scarcity: companies, top 40 charts, copyright, whereas folk cultures strictly employ tools of abundance: volunteers, community halls, public domain. Each has its place but its important to be aware of the different affordances they offer to participants.

## Scarcity meets Abundance

Last week I attended my first tech conference at DevOps Days Wollongong, an incredible experience full of warm people and great conversations but i left a little dizzy, the experience absolutely shattered my mental model of these two camps. On the one hand the ignite talks and open spaces are tools clearly designed to foster grass-roots, fresh ideas, all that folk culture goodness. At the same time many of my interactions felt more about hierarchy than equal exchange. Some open space discussions felt like disjointed battle spaces with each voice vying for that tone of authority: "but see the point really is.." (at times regrettably that voice was my own). As another example one speaker began their talk with 
> "I'm not going to annonce my company or position because I want my ideas to stand on their own merit"
I think this demonstrates the tension between the cultures.

To be clear I don't see this as unique to tech culture, I leave most open discussions feeling drained, but in a community event discussing a medium of abundance, what is driving this behavior of zero-sum competiton?

## The Game Creates the Player

Our behavior is the product of our environment. In environments of scarcity like record labels, companies or universities we need to dominate to survive, this may be done socially and ethically but at the end of the day there is only one contract, one senior position, one tenure etc.

Given a guitar and a book of folk songs we have no interest in domination, there is nothing to dominate. We can freely build on the ideas of others while exploring our own. Tools of abundance are a kind of magic. Neighbors can't seem to agree on much, but one thing we can all get behind is a community garden. Commercial artists are swept behind layers of security guards, but folk festival headliners will likely be swapping stories with you over a beer later that night, chatting as equals.

## The computer revolution still hasn't happened yet

Software is a media of abundance just like music, the authoring tools are accessible and the end product is pure information. As Alan Kay has been [telling anybody who would listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QboI_1WJUlM&t=3686s) for the last 50 years, we create scarcity by introducing [accidental complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) that requrires years of specialized training to wrangle. Even open source projects have elements of scarcity, they are usually designed to solve a specific problem and forking is expensive so they can practically only move in one direction.

Folk technology is alive and well, we can see it in game jams, maker spaces and creative coding workshops, but it is generally limited to students and tech-savvy hobbyists. In order to make tools like scratch, arduino and processing accessible to non-professionals we lower the barrier by teaching imperative design patterns. This is the [doghouse/cathedral metaphore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY&t=814s), anybody can build a doghouse but this design collapses scaled to the size of a cathedral. In tech I think we know how to build cathedrals, but for our own denomination only and without consideration for the broader community.

At DevOps Days Wollongong I gave a talk describing the kinds of silos this results in, and why I think ECS is different. I am now certain that we actually have a shot of fulfilling Kay's vision of the Computer Revolution, technology as beautiful and free as music.
