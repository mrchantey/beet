Rusty tools for developing reative structures.

Sweet builds upon Astro's principle of creating interoperability between various reactive libraries, and extends that capability with support for multiple renderers and authoring flavours.

# Features
- 🔥 **Smokin hot reload** instant reloads for non-code changes
- 🌊 **Stay Hydrated** sweet collects pre-hydration events and plays them back in order, no missed events!
-  **Scoped CSS** with component `<style/>` tags
- 🌐 **Great signal here!** sweet provides integrations with leptos.
- 🦀 **Rusty to the core** components are described as *regular structs and traits*.
- 🧪 **A full ecosystem** sweet has a built-in component library and testing framework, as well as integrations with axum, leptos and bevy.
